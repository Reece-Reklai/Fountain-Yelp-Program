# CPTR 142: Project III

## Proposal
* A most interesting problem definition.
    * You should know that I, your TA, am a water connoisseur, and I believe this project is a righteous one.
    * My filtered tap water has inconsistent flavor. It's irritating.
* Looks good.

## Specifications
* The flow diagram is meant to visualize the flow of your *program,* not your development.
* UML makes sense, simple enough.
* What are your individual roles/responsibilities?
    * A timeline may help motivate you to finish tasks by certain times.
